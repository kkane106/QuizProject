##Quiz Project
####Overview
This is my implementation of a java quiz project using SpringMVC. The functionality should allow users to create quizzes (including demarkating correct answers), and subsequently take them and be given a score based on their performance. In addition to this MVP behavior, it might be beneficial to add multiple user levels, potentially implement multiple quiz types, allow users to have variable numbers of answers etc etc.

####Technology
* JPA
* JavaEE
* SpringMVC
* MySQL
* Eclipselink
* Maven
* JSTL
* HTML/CSS  
  
####Configuration
I have included a MySQL dump file (dump.sql) with the project, should you have interest in using my schema to see how the project runs. MySQL is currently configured to use port 3306, so if you used a default MAMP install you may need to reconfigure your server.
